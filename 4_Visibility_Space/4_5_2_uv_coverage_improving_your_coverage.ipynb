    "The $uv$ plane is an important quantity to monitor when observing with an interferometer. In an ideal case, this plane is the support of the visibility function, characteristic of the sky we want to observe. The $uv$-coverage of an observation tells us which parts of the visibility function has been sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in [$\\S$ 4.5.1 &#10142;](4_5_1_UV_Coverage_UV_Tracks.ipynb) that sampling the $uv$-plane with a single baseline corresponds to sampling an elliptical track,  the parameters of which can be predicted if we know the location of the interferometer on the Earth, the direction of the source and the baseline characteristics. Due to the motion of the Earth, the spatial frequency sampled (at coordinate $u$, $v$) will follow the $uv$ track.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [$\\S$ 4.5.2 &#10549;](4_5_2_UV_Coverage_Improving_Your_Coverage.ipynb), we discussed three different ways of enriching your $uv$ coverage. Firstly, we can increase the number of antennas and their distribution: this improves the *instantaneous* spatial coverage. Second, we can use the fact that the observed source are moving with the Celestial Sphere (i.e. the Earth spins). The continuous variation of the projected baseline - and therefore its $u,v$-coordinates - allow us to sample portions of the elliptical $uv$ tracks with each baseline. A long integration time allows to naturally cover the $uv$ plane at no cost other than computing the signal's correlation at a higher temporal rate (which depends on the desired temporal resolution for each sample). Thirdly, by using broadband receivers, we can sample the visibilities at various frequencies and compute the cross-correlations in different frequency channels. By doing so, the $uv$-coverage is improved along radial $uv$ tracks.\n",
    "Of course, these methods cannot infinitely extend our $uv$-coverage. They are limited by both the instrument sensitivity and the instrument's point source response (see [$\\S$ 9.3 &#10142;](../9_Practical/9_3_Observing_smearing.ipynb)).\n",
