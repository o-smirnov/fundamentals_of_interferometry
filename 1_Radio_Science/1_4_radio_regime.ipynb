    "All of us are familiar with the night sky. In fact, when we think of astronomy, the first picture that comes to mind is that of the star-strewn sky (with a few planets thrown in). People looking at less light-poluted skies are also able to make out details such as the milky band of our own galaxy. \n",

On one end is Gamma-ray astronomy, where individual photons have much larger energy than those in the visible range (and correspondingly much higher frequency) but far fewer numbers. On the other end is radio astronomy, where the photons are plentiful, but their individual energy is much smaller, with much smaller frequency than those in the visible range. \n",

    "The above image is an example of what are called composite images. These are images formed by combining two or more images, generally from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this example we have combined what we see in radio as well as optical frequencies. The object seen in the radio is Cygnus A, a radio galaxy (the closest such object to us). These are huge objects, generated through the activity happening at the centre of a galaxy, through the agency of a supermassive black hole. The latter creates the jets going in opposite directions to create large blobs of plasma called lobes, which radiate at radio frequncies - and are invisible in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. These objects are of cosmological importance; they affect the process of cosmological structure formation at various scales and as such are of great importance in our understanding of the Cosmos. "

    "In the radio image the bridges containing the three galaxies are clearly visible. This does not show up in optical because the gas which forms the bridge does not emit radiation in optical bands. A similar case is that of the rotation curves. Rotation curves are plots of orbital velocities of stuff in a galaxy, against the radial distance from the centre of the galaxy. The idea is to use the orbital velocity to infer the mass in the galaxy inside the particular radius (we expect $v \\propto r^{-1/2}$, in case all the mass is already enclosed inside the radius). In fact, we would expect the orbital velocity to decrease beyond the visible disk, since most of the mass would be inside the radius of the disk. However, in practice we do not see the expected behaviour for the rotation curves- indicating that not all the mass is enclosed within the visible disk. Radio observations of the neutral hydrogen gas, which extends far beyond the visible extent of the galaxy, allow us to trace the rotation curve to large radii. The figure below (courtesy of : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve) illustrates the measurements through 'optical' (stars) and 'radio' (21 cm) measurements:"

    "So the 'radio window' extends from about $10$ MHz (about $30$ m) to $1$ THz (about $0.3$ mm), where it starts going into the infrared regime.
